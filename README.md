# Flask Inventory Managment project

# Languages Used:
- Python
- JQuery
- HTML

# Databases Used:
- SQlite

# Requirements
- Python Packages:
  - SQLAlchemy
- Server(Localhost)

First, you need to clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aparna-205/Inventory-Management-App

```
Then change into the `flask-inventory-app` folder:
```bash
$ cd flask-inventory-app
```
Now, we will need to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies. We have two options available for now.

Use Pipenv:

```bash
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Or use pip + virtualenv:

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate  # on Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate" instead
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Run the Application?

**Before run the application, make sure you have activated the virtual enviroment:**

```bash
$ flask run
```
